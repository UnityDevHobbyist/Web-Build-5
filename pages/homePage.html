                        I am a nineteen year old man attending NSCC (Nova Scotia Community College) in Truro, NS.<br>
                        Lately I have not had the chance to catch up on or explore any hobbies since I have been busy<br>
                        with homework, my job, and chores. Since it is almost Christmas break, I am looking forward to<br>
                        playing video games, building the rest of my custom gaming PC, reading, and watching movies<br> and tv shows.
                        When I was younger I watched a tv show that was really good called West World<br> but I have not gotten around to
                        finishing it. I am thinking of continuing the series.<br>
                        Anyways! That's enough talking from me, have fun exploring my website!
