                I am a nineteen year old man attending NSCC (Nova Scotia Community College) in Truro, NS.<br>
                Lately I haven't had the chance to catch up on or explore any hobbies since I have been busy
                with homework, my job, and chores.<br> Since it's almost Christmas break, I'm looking forward to
                playing video games, building the rest of my custom gaming PC, reading, and watching moives and tv shows.<br>
                When I was younger I watched a tv show that was really good called West World but I haven't gotten around to
                finishing it. I'm excited to continue watching it.<br>
                Anyways! That's enough talking from me, have fun exploring my website!
